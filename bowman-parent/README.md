# bowman-client

This is a modified copy of version 0.9 of the `pom.xml` at [bowman](https://github.com/hdpe/bowman).  Modifications include:
	* Several dependencies were uplifted.  The uplift in HAL dependencies was non-passive.
	* To avoid conflicts, maven coordinates were changed from `me.hdpe.bowman:bowman-parent` to `io.github.da-trunk.naked:bowman-parent`.
